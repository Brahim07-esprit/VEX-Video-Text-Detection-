VEX (Video Text Detection)
==========================

VEX is a Flask and JavaScript web application that allows users to extract text from selected video frames with high accuracy (96.3%). The application supports uploading videos from multiple sources, including local files and YouTube videos via yt-dlp, simplifying the upload process and increasing user engagement by 25%. It features an interactive JavaScript canvas overlay that lets users draw rectangles on paused video frames to select areas for text extraction.
